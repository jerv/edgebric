## 2026-03-31 — mesh-fixes (agent/mesh-fixes branch)

**What**: Fixed 5 failing mesh tests (4 in meshClient.test.ts, 1 in meshInterNode.test.ts).

**Root causes**:
1. `searchAllNodes` tests in meshClient.test.ts had state leaking between tests — `beforeEach` called `deleteMeshConfig()` but never cleared registered nodes from the DB, so nodes accumulated across test runs causing incorrect fetch call counts.
2. `GET /api/mesh/peer/info` endpoint didn't return `meshVisibleSourceCount` field that the test expected.

**Changes**:
- `packages/api/src/services/nodeRegistry.ts` — added `removeAllNodes()` export
- `packages/api/src/__tests__/meshClient.test.ts` — call `removeAllNodes()` in `beforeEach`
- `packages/api/src/routes/meshInterNode.ts` — added `meshVisibleSourceCount` to `/info` response

**Status**: All 39 mesh tests passing. Ready for merge review.
